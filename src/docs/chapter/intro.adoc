== Intro

`Helios` is a micro validation framework that focuses on:

- API simplicity
- Small footprint
- Validator reusability
- Embrace `functional programming`
- Documentation

Many Java validation libraries out there are based on
annotations. Annotations are ok, but then validation depends on having
your data model polluted with them. Moreover, sometimes you may want
to have different validation restrictions on the same type of object
in different parts of the application.
