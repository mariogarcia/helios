== ValidatorError

**link:javadoc/helios/ValidatorError.html[javadoc]**

If any validator fails it will return a list of
`helios.ValidatorError` instances. When a validator is created it
could have the following information:

- `property`: the validated property
- `key`: the error identificator
- `keyI18n`: it's a combination of "$property.$key". It contains a
  unique identifier that can be used to translate the error.

You can create a new `ValidatorError` either by calling its
constructor directly or using the method
`ValidatorError#error`. Although this method was first created to be
used internally, it was pretty clear that it could be very useful to
developers when creating custom validators.

IMPORTANT: All instances of `ValidatorError` are efectively
immutable. All its fields are final and initialized in constructor. It
could be considered thread-safe friendly.
